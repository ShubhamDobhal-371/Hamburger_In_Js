Creating a hamburger menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a web development project where you design and implement a responsive navigation menu. This menu typically consists of a clickable icon (the hamburger) that reveals a navigation menu when clicked or tapped. The project involves structuring the HTML for the menu, styling it with CSS to achieve the desired visual appearance, and using JavaScript to handle the toggle functionality between the closed and open menu states, providing a user-friendly navigation experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
